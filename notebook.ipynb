    "##### Content Based\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests , this filters the recoomendation based on the content category of the user's watch list. Suppose one user is watching superhero movies , marvel/DC a lot. Then netflix will recommend movies like superhero movies to the user\n",

    "##### Popularity Based\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal example would be netflix's top 10 movies in india . Top 10 in Horror movies . This recommendation gets populated based on watch time or popularity of those movies/tv series.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Collaborative filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "netflix here collects the data of a group of users who are watching same kind of content , suppose user a,b,c,d are watching horror and psychological thriller and supense drama movies. Netflix stores their data and their preference. Then suddenly user e comes into picture and starts watching horror movies , based on the previous data netflix will start showing psychological thriller and suspense drama movies to user e , based on the previous data they have collected. This is called collaborative filtering/recommendtaion system."
